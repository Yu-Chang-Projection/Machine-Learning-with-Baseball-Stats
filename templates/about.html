        <p class="about-text hide">Hello there and welcome to the website of Yu Chang Projections!
             Weâ€™re Alan Chang and Darrell Yu, two college students that love baseball and stats.</p>

        <p class="about-title">Motivation</p>
        <p class="about-text hide">We are enthusiastic about Fantasy baseball, 
            so we want to find a better way to evaluate players before the season starts.
            Therefore, we came up with the idea of making our own projection system
            to improve our drafting strategy.</p>

    <span class="about-block goals">
        <p class="about-title">Goals</p>
        <p class="about-text hide">The long-term goal of our project is to create a projection
            model that is accurate in predicting players performance.
            Aside from stats, that should also include predicting
            breakouts and bust performances.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="about-block method">
        <p class="about-title">Methodology</p>
        <p class="about-text hide">In our project, we reference stats from Fangraphs and Statcast 
            for projections. For different to-project stats, we use our function to select the best
             stat combo and feed them into a regression model to train. For example, we use various
              plate discipline stats for our K% projections. As for samples, we select
              players with over 400 plate appearances in a single season from 2015 to 2021.</p>

            Edwin Jackson Played For the Most MLB Teams
            In 2019, pitcher Edwin Jackson became the first player in history to play for 14 
            MLB teams, a feat accomplished within his 17-year career. The previous record was 
            held by Octavio Dotel, also a pitcher. Dotel played for 13 teams during his 
            15-year MLB career.</p>
